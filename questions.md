# Finite Elements
- right now i have order=1 and degree=2. convergence seems to be second order. what are these parameters
    - here is says to set degree to at least 2*order: https://gridap.github.io/Tutorials/dev/pages/t013_poisson_dev_fe/
- the error of the numerical solutions seems to go to zero at the edge of each cell. is this expected? isn't this a little weird?
